Assignment 3: STL HashMap (short answer questions)
Names: tk wang

1. at() vs []
The at() has bound check. And at won't create a pair if the key is not exist.
The operator [] will create a pair with empty value: {key, {}}, if the key is not exist.

Because [non_exist_key] will create value. const HashMap can not do operator[].

2. Find vs. 𝓕𝓲𝓷𝓭
std::find function uses a loop iterate all key.
HashMap::find uses hash function obtain a bucket index. Faster than std::find.

3. RAII?
Yes! HashMap has a destructor. The destructor will clear the resource of HashMap object.

4. Increments
Iterate all node in the bucket. And iterate all bucket.

1. Attachment Issues
The std::vector's copy constructor/assignment operator is member wise copy. But _buckets_array's element is pointer.
So the copy constructor is needed. Because the Rule of Five. We should implement SMFs.

2. Move Semantics
Yes
